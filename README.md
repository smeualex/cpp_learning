# Sample programs from Reiner Grimm's STL book

## Building

Simply call `build.py build` which will build everything and put all the executables in `bin` subdirectory.

## examples

The examples contain small executables illustrating a single concept.
Each file is built to its own executable.

In fact, this is a requirement, based on how the `CMakeLists.txt` file is structured for this folder. Only single-source-file executables.
